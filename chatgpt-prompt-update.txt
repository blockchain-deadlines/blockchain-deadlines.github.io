The task is as follows: I will give you YAML metadata that captures basic information (such as title, location, date, ...) about an academic venue (that could be a conference, or journal, etc.), as well as the relevant deadlines for submitting to the venue (a venue may have multiple cycles; it is important to have an entry for each cycle). Specifically, the information I will provide you with is outdated and will be of the most recent (past) edition of the venue, for instance about the conference's edition in 2023. Your task is to check whether you can find a website for the next edition (usually for the 2024 edition) of the venue with a call-for-paper (CFP) that contains the updated information. You will then provide me with updated YAML information accordingly.

I will provide examples below for properly formatted but outdated information, so that you can learn the YAML format.
Sometimes for each cycle there may be an abstract registration deadline and a full paper submission deadline. Then use the first deadline for the `deadline` and `timezone` field, and specify the later deadline in the `note` field.
Sort the fields of each YAML entry as in the examples below.
For the `title` and `full_title` fields, do not use the year of the conference or the number of the installment of the conference.
Make sure to specify the cycle in the `note` field and in the `id` field.

When deadlines are specified in anywhere-on-earth (AoE), this corresponds to 23:59:59 in the latest possible timezone, which is typically UTC-12 = Etc/GMT+12.

Sometimes, the deadline information is not available on the conference's main website. In those cases, please find a link on the main page to the call-for-papers (CFP). Visit the page of the CFP, and obtain more information including submission cycles and/or deadlines from there.

Here are examples of the YAML format I want you to create:
