Your task is: a) to find out if the YAML data I will provide you with subsequently corresponds to the most recent upcoming edition of the particular venue, or whether the information is outdated and there is newer information available on the Internet, and b) to provide updated YAML data for the latest edition of the venue, according to the call-for-papers (CFP) that you can find online on the website for the latest edition of the venue. 

Key information captured in the YAML data are the relevant deadlines for submitting to the venue: a venue may have multiple cycles, and it is important to have an entry for each cycle. If a cycle has multiple deadlines, for instance an earlier abstract registration deadline, and a later full paper submission deadline, it is important that you use the earliest deadline in the `deadline` and `timezone` fields of YAML, and specify the later deadlines in the `note` field.
Sort the fields of each YAML entry as in the examples above.
For the `title` and `full_title` fields, do not use the year of the conference or the number of the installment of the conference.
Make sure to specify the cycle in the `note` field and in the `id` field.
When deadlines are specified in anywhere-on-earth (AoE), this corresponds to 23:59:59 in the latest possible timezone, which is typically UTC-12 = Etc/GMT+12.

Stick to the YAML format (field names and usage of fields) of the examples I have provided you with. Be concise. Don't give me any explanation/reasoning, just the updated YAML.

Sometimes, the deadline information is not available on the conference's main website. In those cases, please find a link on the main page to the call-for-papers (CFP). Visit the page of the CFP, and obtain more information including submission cycles and/or deadlines from there.

Understood?
