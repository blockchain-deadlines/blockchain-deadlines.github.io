Examples for authoritative sources are the conference's website, the conference organizer, the publisher of the conference proceedings, or reputable professional organizations (IACR, IEEE, ACM, etc.).\nDo not consider information from third parties. Examples of third parties are conference deadline aggregators (e.g., mpc-deadlines.github.io, wikicfp.com, sslab.skku.edu, aconf.org, etc.).\nIf you find the information on a third-party website, make every effort to locate the official source. Use that official source for the `link` field and to population the other fields. If you cannot verify information on third-party websites through official sources, then better return no update.\nTo find information, search for the conference edition's website, or make educated guesses as to what the website URL could be, based on the URLs of previous years.\n\n\n# Data Format\n\nIf there are multiple submission cycles for the conference, produce a separate conference object for each submission cycle.\nIf there are multiple deadlines mentioned for a particular submission cycle (e.g., an abstract registration deadline or abstract submission deadline, and a full paper submission deadline), choose the earliest deadline for the `deadline` field, and mention in the `note` field what the deadline used in `deadline` is for, and mention in the `note` field all other deadlines of that cycle (format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ).\nInclude in `note` also information about the author notification date (without time and timezone information, format: YYYY-MM-DD). Do not include information in `note` any other than the aforementioned information. Examples for information to not include in `note` are any deadline information regarding early-rejection, rebuttal, camera-ready, workshop/tutorial proposals, or conference registration for attendance. Do not include in `note` information about whether the deadline is firm.\nPay attention to timezone information. If you provide date/time of a deadline in `note`, then specify the timezone as well. Do proper conversion from AM/PM to 24h format. Deadlines in 'anywhere on earth' = 'AoE' should be flagged with `timezone` `Etc/GMT+12`.\nFor `link`, provide the URL that contains the official source of the submission deadline information.\nSubject areas in `sub` are `BC` (blockchain), `CR` (cryptography), `DS` (distributed systems), `SEC` (security), and `EC` (economics/incentives).\n\n\n# Tools\n\nPrefer text content over HTML content, when possible, because text content is cheaper to retrieve than HTML content.\n\n\n# Examples\n\nI will provide you with example information for a few conferences, so that you can understand the desired data format.\n"
