Examples for authoritative sources are the conference's website, the conference organizer, the publisher of the conference proceedings, or reputable professional organizations (IACR, IEEE, ACM, etc.).\nDo not consider information from third parties. Examples of third parties are conference deadline aggregators (e.g., mpc-deadlines.github.io, wikicfp.com, sslab.skku.edu, aconf.org, etc.).\nIf you find the information on a third-party website, make every effort to locate the official source. Use that official source for the `link` field and to population the other fields. If you cannot verify information on third-party websites through official sources, then better return no update.\nTo find information, search for the conference edition's website, or make educated guesses as to what the website URL could be, based on the URLs of previous years.\n\n\n# Data Format\n\nIf there are multiple submission cycles for the conference, produce a separate conference object for each submission cycle.\nIf there are multiple deadlines mentioned for a particular submission cycle (e.g., an abstract registration deadline or abstract submission deadline, and a full paper submission deadline), choose the earliest deadline for the `deadline` field, and mention in the `note` field what the deadline used in `deadline` is for, and mention in the `note` field all other deadlines of that cycle (format: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS TZ).\nInclude in `note` also information about the author notification date (without time and timezone information, format: YYYY-MM-DD). Do not include information in `note` any other than the aforementioned information. Examples for information to not include in `note` are any deadline information regarding early-rejection, rebuttal, camera-ready, workshop/tutorial proposals, or conference registration for attendance. Do not include in `note` information about whether the deadline is firm.\nPay attention to timezone information. If you provide date/time of a deadline in `note`, then specify the timezone as well. Do proper conversion from AM/PM to 24h format. Deadlines in 'anywhere on earth' = 'AoE' should be flagged with `timezone` `Etc/GMT+12`.\nFor `link`, provide the URL that contains the official source of the submission deadline information.\nSubject areas in `sub` are `BC` (blockchain), `CR` (cryptography), `DS` (distributed systems), `SEC` (security), and `EC` (economics/incentives).\n\n\n# Tools\n\nPrefer text content over HTML content, when possible, because text content is cheaper to retrieve than HTML content.\n\n\n# Examples\n\nI will provide you with example information for a few conferences, so that you can understand the desired data format.\n"

In\\n        nearly every case, disclosing the vulnerability to vendors of affected systems, and other stakeholders, will\\n        help\\n        protect users. It is the committee\\u2019s sense that a disclosure window of 45 days to 90 days ahead of publication\\n        is\\n        consistent with authors\\u2019 ethical obligations.\", \"Longer disclosure windows (which may keep vulnerabilities from the public for extended periods of time) should\\n        only be considered in exceptional situations, e.g., if the affected parties have provided convincing evidence\\n        the\\n        vulnerabilities were previously unknown and the full rollout of mitigations requires additional time. The\\n        authors\\n        are encouraged to consult with the PC chairs in case of questions or concerns.\\n        The version of the paper submitted for review must discuss in detail the steps the authors have taken or plan to\\n        take to address these vulnerabilities; but, consistent with the timelines above, the authors do not have to\\n        disclose vulnerabilities ahead of submission. The PC chairs will be happy to consult with authors about how this\\n        policy applies to their submissions.\"]",
