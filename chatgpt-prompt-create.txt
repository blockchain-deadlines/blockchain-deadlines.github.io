The task is as follows: Given the URL of an academic conference, you need to generate YAML metadata that captures basic information about the conference, as well as the relevant deadlines for submitting to the conference. Here are two examples:

For the USENIX Security conference whose website is: https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24
The desired YAML output is:
"""
- title: USENIX Security
  year: 2024
  id: usenixsec24summer
  full_title: USENIX Security Symposium
  link: https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24
  deadline: '2023-06-06 23:59:59'
  timezone: Etc/GMT+12
  note: Summer deadline.
  sub: [SEC]
  place: Philadelphia, PA, USA
  date: August 14-16, 2024
  start: 2024-08-14
  end: 2024-08-16

- title: USENIX Security
  year: 2024
  id: usenixsec24fall
  full_title: USENIX Security Symposium
  link: https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24
  deadline: '2023-10-17 23:59:59'
  timezone: Etc/GMT+12
  note: Fall deadline.
  sub: [SEC]
  place: Philadelphia, PA, USA
  date: August 14-16, 2024
  start: 2024-08-14
  end: 2024-08-16

- title: USENIX Security
  year: 2024
  id: usenixsec24winter
  full_title: USENIX Security Symposium
  link: https://www.usenix.org/conference/usenixsecurity24
  deadline: '2024-02-08 23:59:59'
  timezone: Etc/GMT+12
  note: Winter deadline.
  sub: [SEC]
  place: Philadelphia, PA, USA
  date: August 14-16, 2024
  start: 2024-08-14
  end: 2024-08-16
"""

For IEEE EuroS&P whose the website is: https://eurosp2024.ieee-security.org/
The desired YAML output is:
"""
- title: IEEE EuroS&P
  year: 2024
  id: eurosp24
  full_title: IEEE European Symposium on Security and Privacy
  link: https://eurosp2024.ieee-security.org/
  deadline: '2023-10-30 23:59:59'
  timezone: Etc/GMT+12
  note: Deadline for abstract registration. Paper deadline 2023-11-02 AoE.
  sub: [DS, SEC]
  place: Vienna, Austria
  date: July 8-12, 2024
  start: 2024-07-08
  end: 2024-07-12
"""

Thus, if multiple deadlines are provided on the website, for instance a first one for abstract/paper registration, and a second one one for full paper submission, then use the first deadline for the `deadline` and `timezone` field, and specify the later deadline in the `note` field.
Sort the fields of each YAML entry as above.
For the `title` and `full_title` fields, do not use the year of the conference or the number of the installment of the conference.
Make sure to specify the cycle in the `note` field and in the `id` field.

When deadlines are specified in anywhere-on-earth (AoE), this corresponds to 23:59:59 in the latest possible timezone, which is typically UTC-12 = Etc/GMT+12.

Sometimes, the deadline information is not available on the conference's main website. In those cases, please find a link on the main page to the call-for-papers (CFP). Visit the page of the CFP, and obtain more information including submission cycles and/or deadlines from there.
